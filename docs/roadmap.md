Below is a master implementation roadmap for a lightweight, scalable open‑source symbolic computation engine (CAS) focused on the engine only—no UI/notebooks. It’s structured so a small core team can execute in phases, with clear deliverables, acceptance criteria, and performance/size budgets. I assume Rust for the core (safety + performance + easy WebAssembly) with Python bindings for adoption; if you prefer C++, you can map the same plan almost 1:1.

0) Project Vision & Guardrails

Primary goal: A compact, fast, embeddable symbolic engine covering:
	•	symbolic expressions (algebra)
	•	simplification & rewriting
	•	calculus (diff, basic limits/series, staged integration)
	•	equation solving (linear, polynomial first; staged transcendental)
	•	symbolic matrices/linear algebra
	•	numeric evaluation (arbitrary precision)

Non-goals (for v1): notebooks/plots/UI, PDEs, full Risch, full Gröbner bases for large multivariate ideals, computer algebra for noncommutative structures, comprehensive special‑function encyclopedias.

Principles:
	•	Lightweight: minimal deps; modular crates; build-time feature flags; WASM target.
	•	Deterministic: canonical forms; reproducible outputs.
	•	Safe & scalable: immutability, DAG sharing, resource guards, linear/multithread scalability for large operand sets.
	•	Extensible: plugin-like modules; registry for functions/rules; stable public API.

Initial target budgets (soft):
	•	Core static lib (release, stripped): < 10–15 MB (Rust; WASM < ~2–5 MB gzipped with features pruned).
	•	Typical operations on expressions with ~10⁴ nodes complete in sub-second on commodity CPU (after warm caches).
	•	Memory overhead: sub‑linear growth via DAG/consing; avoid quadratic blowups by design.

2) Core Data Model & Performance Design

2.1 Expression kernel (immutable DAG + hash‑consing)
	•	Node = { OpTag, smallvec<ChildId>, Payload } where Payload holds immediates (e.g., small ints) or function symbols.
	•	Arena Store per “session”:
	•	Hash‑consing: unique table keyed by (OpTag, normalized children, payload) → NodeId to guarantee structural sharing.
	•	Refcounts (Arc) or generation indices to reclaim unreachable subgraphs.
	•	Canonicalization-in-construction: flatten associative ops (Add, Mul), sort operands (deterministic), separate numeric part (coefficient) from symbolic monomials.
	•	Atom interning: Symbols, small integers, common constants (0,1,π,e,i) are interned.
	•	Equality: pointer equality ⇒ structural equality (thanks to consing); deep equals only on store boundary.
	•	Hashing: stable, cached per node; use strong hasher; memoized.

2.2 Types (first wave)
Integer, Rational, Symbol, Constant, Add, Mul, Pow, Function, Piecewise, Relational(=,≠,<,≤,>).
Later: AlgebraicNumber, Complex literal, MatrixExpr.

2.3 Assumptions system (skeleton)
	•	3-valued lattice per property: {True, False, Unknown} for real, positive, integer, nonzero, finite, ...;
	•	Scoped context; rewrite honors assumptions (no unsafe simplifications).

⸻

3) Simplification & Rewriting Strategy

3.1 Default simplifier (fast, safe, local)
	•	Constant folding; unit/zero elimination; combine like terms/factors; rational normalization with polynomial GCD.
	•	Canonical ordering of operands and terms; fraction normalization (cancel GCD numerator/denominator).
	•	No expansion/factorization by default (avoid expression swell).

3.2 Rewrite system (explicit)
	•	Substitution v1: symbol→expr; exact head matches.
	•	Rules registry: (pattern, constraints) -> replacement; rule families keyed by OpTag.
	•	AC-aware matching v2 (Add/Mul commutativity/associativity) with multiset matching; cost-based chooser.
	•	Strategy: bounded, confluent-ish pipelines: normalize → cheap rules → domain-aware rules → (optional) heavy transforms with iteration caps and size guards.
	•	Optional advanced: e-graph-based saturation behind a feature flag (kept out of default build for lightness).

⸻

4) Algebra & Polynomials

4.1 Arithmetic kernel
	•	BigInt/Rational via a single trait; implement with rug (GMP/MPFR) or pure-Rust bigints behind feature flags.
	•	Exact arithmetic; rational canonicalization everywhere.

4.2 Polynomial module
	•	Univariate dense for small degree; sparse (hashmap) for multi-variate.
	•	Algorithms:
	•	Euclidean division; subresultant PRS; GCD; square‑free decomposition.
	•	Factorization skeleton: trial division; Berlekamp/EDF over finite fields + rational reconstruction (staged in later phase).
	•	Resultants; discriminants; partial fractions (proper/improper).
	•	Tight conversion: Expr ⟷ Poly when heads permit.

⸻

5) Calculus

5.1 Differentiation (v1)
	•	Structural rules for Add/Mul/Pow/Function with chain/product/quotient; derivative tables for common functions; simplify-on-the-fly.

5.2 Limits & series (v1)
	•	Heuristic limits (polynomial dominance, L’Hôpital for simple forms).
	•	Series: univariate Taylor/Maclaurin for standard functions; operations on series (add/mul/compose/truncate).

5.3 Integration (phased)
	•	v1: rational functions via partial fractions; linear change-of-variable detection; basic ∫f’/f forms; common trig/exponential patterns.
	•	v2: heuristic Risch fragments (exp/log towers); integration by parts orchestrator; table lookup with validation.
	•	v3 (optional): full transcendental Risch subsets; algebraic function handling.

⸻

6) Solvers

6.1 Linear algebraic solve
	•	Exact linear system solving (fraction‑free Gaussian elimination / Bareiss), LU for rationals.
	•	Determinant, rank, nullspace (symbolic).

6.2 Polynomial equations
	•	Univariate: factor → roots (closed forms up to quartic; otherwise root objects / isolating intervals).
	•	Systems (phased): resultants/elimination; Gröbner bases (Buchberger) behind a feature flag (later).

6.3 Transcendental equations (v1)
	•	Patterned forms (e.g., a*exp(bx)=c → LambertW); fallback: numeric root-finding under evalf with certification if intervals enabled.

⸻

7) Matrix / Linear Algebra
	•	Symbolic matrices with exact entries; lazy simplification of elements.
	•	Determinant via Bareiss; adjugate/inverse when feasible; block operations.
	•	Polynomial matrices (Smith normal form later).

⸻

8) Numeric Evaluation (evalf)
	•	Arbitrary precision floats (MPFR via rug), complex support; round-half-even; controllable precision context.
	•	Interval arithmetic (optional feature) for certified bounds in numeric solve/integrate.

⸻

9) API, Interop & Tooling

9.1 Public API
	•	Rust crate API (Expr builder, visitors, simplify, diff, integrate, solve, matrix ops).
	•	C FFI + stable ABI for other languages.
	•	Python bindings (pyo3) exposing idiomatic names; install via pip.

9.2 Serialization & I/O
	•	Parser for a compact math syntax (operators, function calls, piecewise).
	•	Printers: pretty text, Unicode math, LaTeX; machine formats: S‑expr, JSON/CBOR (schema versioned).

9.3 WASM
	•	Small surface: parse → expr; evaluate/simplify/diff/solve; print.
	•	Resource caps enforced (time/steps/memory).

⸻

10) Resource Governance, Security & Observability
	•	Guards: max nodes, max depth, max rewrite steps, max expansion, timeouts (cooperative), numeric precision cap.
	•	Determinism: canonical ordering; seeded but stable tie‑breakers.
	•	Metrics: op counters, node counts, cache hit rates; optional tracing spans.
	•	Errors: rich diagnostics (why a simplification didn’t apply; which rule matched).

⸻

11) Testing & Quality
	•	Unit tests per module with table-driven cases.
	•	Property tests (e.g., d/dx ∫ f dx ~ f on safe classes; expand(f*g)==expand(f)*expand(g) within degree bounds).
	•	Golden tests for printers/serialization.
	•	Differential testing: randomly generate expressions; compare certain outcomes with a reference engine (when behavior is mathematically unambiguous).
	•	Fuzzing of parser and simplifier.
	•	Benchmarks: micro (Add/Mul combine; GCD; partial fractions) and macro (symbolic determinant for k×k, expand (x+1)^n under guard).

⸻

12) Documentation & Governance
	•	Architecture docs (module responsibilities, invariants, data model).
	•	Contribution guide (rule authoring, function registration, test patterns).
	•	API docs with runnable examples.
	•	Release policy (semver; feature flags listed).
	•	License: MIT or Apache‑2.0 (permissive); call out dependency licenses; optional CLA.

	•	Finalize semver 1.0 API; write migration/compat notes.

Acceptance
	•	Crash-free fuzzing over threshold corpus; rule regressions gated; docs complete; tagged release.

⸻

14) Rule & Function Extension Model
	•	Function registry: to add a function F, provide metadata: arity/variadic, algebraic properties (odd/even, monotonic, branch), derivative rule, evalf routine, simplification hooks.
	•	Rule registry DSL: let contributors define pattern→rewrite with guards (e.g., (a_*x + b_*x) -> (a+b)*x with type/assumption checks).
	•	Module isolation: heavy domains (e.g., special functions, Gröbner) live behind feature flags.

⸻

15) Performance Tactics (throughout)
	•	Hash‑consing + memoization (per‑store caches for expand, gcd, diff).
	•	Avoid expansion by default; provide expand/factor explicitly.
	•	Fraction‑free algorithms (Bareiss) to control intermediate swell.
	•	Parallelizable operations (e.g., map over large Add/Mul child lists) using work‑stealing, with deterministic reduction order.
	•	CSE for output (optional) to shrink printed/generated code.
	•	Bench harness that tracks node counts, rewrite steps, allocation rates, peak RSS.

⸻

16) Risk Register & Mitigations
	•	Expression swell → strict defaults (no auto expand), fraction‑free methods, guards, user‑requested heavy ops only.
	•	Pattern matcher blowups → strategy caps, cost heuristics, rule grouping by head, optional e‑graph only behind flag.
	•	Numeric/library size → feature flags (bigint=on/off, mpfr=on/off), dual backends (pure-Rust vs GMP) to fit environments.
	•	Branch cuts/domain correctness → assumptions default to complex; require guards for real‑only rewrites; add diagnostics.
	•	API churn → public API review gates; semver discipline; deprecation paths.

⸻

17) Initial Backlog (actionable tickets)
	1.	expr_core: Arena + consing table + Node layout + canonical Add/Mul/Pow.
	2.	arith: BigInt/Rational traits + canonicalization; Constant atoms.
	3.	io: S‑expr/JSON serializer + minimal parser; pretty printer.
	4.	simplify: combine-like terms/factors; rational normalization; idempotence checks.
	5.	pattern v1: substitution engine, alpha‑equivalence where relevant.
	6.	polys v1: uni dense + multi sparse; GCD; partial fractions.
	7.	calculus: diff rules; simplify-on-derive.
	8.	matrix: fraction‑free Gaussian elimination; determinant.
	9.	solver v1: univariate solve via factor; quadratic–quartic formulas.
	10.	integration v1: rationals + f’/f + simple trig/exp patterns.
	11.	assumptions v1: 3‑valued lattice; scope; hooks in simplifier.
	12.	bindings: C ABI + Python (pyo3) minimal surface.
	13.	wasm: build + tiny demo.
	14.	QA: property tests; fuzzing seeds; micro/macro benches.

⸻

18) Release Train (capability slices)
	•	Alpha: A–C (core + simplify + polynomials)
	•	Beta: + D–G (diff/limits/series, matrices, univariate solving, rational integration)
	•	RC: + H–I (pattern v2, assumptions v2)
	•	1.0: + J–K–L (integration/solve staging, WASM/Python packaging, hardening)

⸻

19) What “Lightweight & Scalable” means concretely here
	•	Lightweight: small, dependency-lean builds; feature flags to disable heavy algebra (e.g., Groebner, MPFR); no background daemons; pure library + small CLI.
	•	Scalable:
	•	Handles many small subterms efficiently (flat n‑ary Add/Mul, SIMD‑friendly loops, parallel map/reduce over children).
	•	Avoids super‑linear blowups via canonical forms and fraction‑free algorithms.
	•	Stable memory behavior via DAG sharing; expression metrics and guards prevent pathological workloads.

⸻

Done right, this plan yields a compact, safe, high‑performance core you can embed anywhere (CLI, services, browsers via WASM, Python). You get immediate utility at Beta (symbolic algebra, diff/limits/series, linear solve, rational integration), and a clear path to deepen capabilities without compromising the lightweight core.
