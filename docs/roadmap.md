## Architectural Principles

### 1. Incremental Complexity Management
- Layered architecture: each phase builds on previous
- Feature flags for heavy algorithms
- Graceful degradation: return partial results or `None`
- Complexity budgets: max expression size, depth, time

### 2. Correctness-First Development
- Differential verification for integration
- Property-based testing for algebraic laws
- Cross-validation with SymPy/Mathematica
- Proof obligations documented

### 3. Performance by Design
- Algorithmic selection: best asymptotic complexity
- Memoization at expression subtree level
- Lazy evaluation: defer until needed
- Parallel opportunities identified

### 4. Extensibility Through Composition
- Trait-based design for common operations
- Registry pattern for functions/rules
- Visitor pattern for tree traversal
- Plugin architecture

### 5. Error Handling Philosophy
- Explicit failure: `Option<T>` or `Result<T, E>`
- Partial results when full solution not found
- Rich error messages
- Timeout guards

### 6. Testing Strategy
- Unit tests: known inputs/outputs
- Property tests: algebraic laws
- Differential tests: compare with references
- Regression tests: capture bugs
- Benchmark tests: performance tracking

### 7. Documentation as Code
- Algorithm documentation with math background
- Complexity analysis for each operation
- Runnable examples for every public API
- Research references to papers/textbooks

### 8. Backward Compatibility
- Semantic versioning strictly followed
- Deprecation policy: 2+ minor versions before removal
- API stability for core operations
- Migration guides for breaking changes

---

## Cross-Cutting Concerns

### Performance Monitoring
- Comprehensive benchmark suite
- CI fails if performance degrades >10%
- Regular profiling with flamegraph
- Memory tracking (arena allocator, hash-consing)

### Security & Resource Management
```rust
pub struct ResourceLimits {
    max_expression_size: usize,      // Default: 1_000_000 nodes
    max_expression_depth: usize,     // Default: 10_000
    max_computation_time: Duration,  // Default: 60s
    max_memory_usage: usize,         // Default: 1GB
}
```

### Code Quality Standards
**Pre-Commit Checklist:**
- ‚úÖ `cargo fmt --all -- --check`
- ‚úÖ `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings`
- ‚úÖ `cargo test --workspace --all-features`
- ‚úÖ `cargo doc --workspace --no-deps`
- ‚úÖ Coverage maintained >85%

**Code Review Requirements:**
- Two approving reviews
- Test coverage for new code
- Documentation for public APIs
- Performance benchmarks for critical changes

### Dependency Management
- Minimize dependencies (prefer std)
- Run `cargo audit` on every commit
- Only MIT/Apache-2.0 compatible licenses
- Optional dependencies behind feature flags
