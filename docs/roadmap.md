## Cross-Cutting Concerns

### Performance Monitoring
- Comprehensive benchmark suite
- CI fails if performance degrades >10%
- Regular profiling with flamegraph
- Memory tracking (arena allocator, hash-consing)

### Security & Resource Management
```rust
pub struct ResourceLimits {
    max_expression_size: usize,      // Default: 1_000_000 nodes
    max_expression_depth: usize,     // Default: 10_000
    max_computation_time: Duration,  // Default: 60s
    max_memory_usage: usize,         // Default: 1GB
}
```

### Code Quality Standards
**Pre-Commit Checklist:**
- ✅ `cargo fmt --all -- --check`
- ✅ `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings`
- ✅ `cargo test --workspace --all-features`
- ✅ `cargo doc --workspace --no-deps`
- ✅ Coverage maintained >85%

**Code Review Requirements:**
- Two approving reviews
- Test coverage for new code
- Documentation for public APIs
- Performance benchmarks for critical changes

### Dependency Management
- Minimize dependencies (prefer std)
- Run `cargo audit` on every commit
- Only MIT/Apache-2.0 compatible licenses
- Optional dependencies behind feature flags
