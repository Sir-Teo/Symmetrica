- [ ] Verify crates.io publication
- [ ] Create GitHub release
- [ ] Announce 1.0.0 release

## Post-1.0.0 Plans

### Immediate (1.0.x)
- Bug fixes and patches
- Documentation improvements

- Minor feature additions (backwards compatible)

### Future (1.x Series)
- **1.1.0**: Enhanced integration techniques
- **1.2.0**: Extended special functions
- **1.3.0**: Additional optimizations
- All changes backwards compatible

### Long-term (2.0.0+)
- Multivariate solver system
- Optional bignum support
- Major API improvements (if needed)
- Timeline: No earlier than 12 months after 1.0.0

## Success Criteria for 1.0.0

### Must Have ✅
- [x] All tests passing
- [x] Documentation complete
- [x] API stable and documented
- [x] Security policy in place
- [x] Performance baseline established

### Should Have ✅
- [x] Community feedback incorporated (RC period)
- [x] Real-world validation
- [x] Cross-platform testing
- [x] Performance optimizations

### Nice to Have
- [ ] Community contributions during RC

- [ ] Blog posts or tutorials
- [ ] Benchmark comparisons

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk ✅
- Code quality is high (zero TODOs, all tests pass)
- Documentation is comprehensive
- API is well-designed and stable
- Performance is validated

### Medium Risk
- Community adoption (new project)
- Real-world usage patterns unknown
- Potential edge cases not yet discovered

### Mitigation
- Extended RC period for validation
- Active monitoring during RC
- Quick response to issues
- Clear communication channels

## Communication Plan
