# Test Coverage Improvements

This document tracks test coverage improvements and identifies areas that need additional testing.

## Current Coverage Status

As of version 1.0.0, Symmetrica has comprehensive test coverage across all major modules:

- **Core Expression System** (`expr_core`): ~95% coverage
- **Arithmetic** (`arith`): 100% coverage
- **Calculus** (`calculus`): ~90% coverage
- **Matrix Operations** (`matrix`): ~92% coverage
- **Polynomial Operations** (`polys`): ~88% coverage
- **Simplification** (`simplify`): ~85% coverage
- **Solver** (`solver`): ~90% coverage
- **Pattern Matching** (`pattern`): ~87% coverage
- **I/O** (`io`): ~95% coverage

## Areas for Improvement

### High Priority

1. **Gröbner Basis Performance** (`grobner`)
   - Current: Basic implementation with performance limitations
   - Need: Optimized Buchberger algorithm for complex multi-variable systems
   - Status: Some tests marked as ignored due to performance issues

2. **Bessel Functions** (`special/bessel`)
   - Current: Basic BesselJ and BesselI implementations for integer orders
   - Need: Full implementation of BesselY and BesselK numerical evaluation
   - Need: Support for non-integer orders
   - Status: Partial implementation

3. **Special Functions** (`special`)
   - Current: Gamma, Erf, Ei functions implemented
   - Need: More comprehensive Bessel function support
   - Need: Additional special functions (hypergeometric, etc.)

### Medium Priority

4. **Tensor Operations** (`tensor`)
   - Current: Basic Einstein notation support
   - Need: More comprehensive tests for complex tensor contractions
   - Need: Performance optimization for large tensors

5. **Summation** (`summation`)
   - Current: Gosper's algorithm and basic summations
   - Need: More complex summation patterns
   - Need: Infinite series convergence tests

6. **Number Theory** (`number_theory`)
   - Current: Basic primitives implemented
   - Need: More comprehensive factorization tests
   - Need: Cryptographic applications

### Low Priority

7. **Documentation Tests** (`tests_e2e`)
   - Current: Basic documentation completeness checks
   - Need: More comprehensive documentation examples
   - Need: Tutorial-style documentation tests

8. **Algebraic Operations** (`algebraic`)
   - Current: Radical denesting implemented
   - Need: More algebraic simplification patterns
   - Need: Algebraic extension support

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- All modules have comprehensive unit tests
- Property-based testing using `proptest` for critical functions
- Edge case coverage for boundary conditions

### Integration Tests
- End-to-end tests in `tests_e2e` crate
- API stability guarantees tests
- Differential tests for calculus operations

### Performance Tests
- Benchmarks for critical paths
- Regression tests for performance improvements
- Memory usage tracking

## Continuous Integration

All tests are run on every commit via GitHub Actions:
- Cargo test (all features)
- Cargo fmt (formatting)
- Cargo clippy (linting)
- Cargo doc (documentation build)
- Cargo tarpaulin (code coverage)

## Coverage Goals

- **Target**: 85%+ overall code coverage
- **Critical modules**: 90%+ coverage (expr_core, arith, calculus)
- **New features**: 80%+ coverage required before merge

## How to Contribute

To improve test coverage:

1. Run `cargo tarpaulin --workspace --all-features` to see current coverage
2. Identify uncovered lines in the HTML report
3. Add tests for uncovered code paths
4. Submit a PR with new tests and coverage improvements
